# Expo Go Setup for React Native Development

## üìå Objective
Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development.  
To ensure a smooth development experience, we will be using the **Expo Framework** for React Native, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

This task focuses on setting up **Expo Go** on your physical device.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure you already have the following installed:
- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended IDE)  
- A compatible operating system: **macOS, Linux, or Windows**

## üì≤ Why Expo Go?
Unlike web development, mobile development typically relies on device emulators to test applications.  
However, emulators require high computational resources and keeping up with the ever-changing mobile ecosystem can be costly.

**Expo Go** provides a cost-effective solution by allowing you to:
- Run and test React Native applications directly on your **physical device**.
- Support both **iOS** and **Android** seamlessly.
- Avoid dependency on heavy emulators.
